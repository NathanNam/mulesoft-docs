* Connector APIDoc documentation is provided intelligently at design time, serving as a contextual help feature

* Supports byte-type and short-type parameters in processor.
* Supports Gregorian Calendar in DSQL query.
* CTF doesn’t throw NullPointerException when a process returns legitimate empty body.

* CTF generates a well-formated JSON for metadata.
* Supports MetaDataKeyParam.BOTH and MetaDataKeyParam.INPUT in processors properly.
